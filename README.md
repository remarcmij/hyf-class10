# hyf-class10

This is an off-curriculum starter project for HYF class 10, who, at the time of writing, are still in the middle of learning JavaScript.

This application displays a list of bilingual sentences (currently English -> Dutch) that match criteria as specified through an API end point.

It constitutes a SPA (Single Page Application), using direct DOM manipulation with JavaScript and uses a supporting backend server that runs on the same computer. The backend server makes use of the `json-server` package that takes its data from a `json` file.

## Installation

Install the repo (replace <project folder> with the name of the folder where you keep of your HYF work. In this folder a hyf-class10 subfolder will be created by the git clone command below):

```
cd <project folder>
git clone https://github.com/remarcmij/hyf-class10.git
cd hyf-class10
npm install
npm start
Open File Explorer (Windows) or equivalent on Mac or Linux and go to the hyf-class10 folder.
```

Double-click the index.html file to open it in the browser.

Note: you need to repeat the command `npm start` from the `hyf-class10` folder in case you have (re)started your computer or killed the terminal/command window where this command was running.
